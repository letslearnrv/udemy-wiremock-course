# Don’t think API Mocking is linked to only enterprise tools like CA LISA, Devtest, Parasoft Virtualize, IBM RIT, Tosca, ServiceV Pro ; it can be implemented in many open source tools like Blazemeter Service virtualization, Hoverfly, SoapUI, Postman, Wiremock,Mockoon,Mocklab, Wiremock Cloud and many more

# NOTE: 
API mocking OR API Virtualization OR Service Virtualization are used interchangibly every where.They differ from each other only on the purpose they are being used for and also on the scale we need it . Sometimes we need to mock only specific components however in some case whole stack need to be virtualized where enterprise tool pitch in to serve the purpose.

It is the perfect opportunity to grab and learn about something that is rising in popularity .
